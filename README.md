# Mod 1 Week 5 Assessment

## Questions (10 Points Possible)
1. What would happen if you try to use a variable that is not in scope?
It will begin a error, since that vriable cannot be access outside its code block.
2. Describe the three As of a test:  
A - Arrange: setup the objects, variables, etc. that you need for the test.
  
A - Act: execute the method correctly.

A - Assert: what to expect from the successful execution of the method.
  

3. What is the difference between `public` and `private` access modifiers?
Locked or unlocked. Private can only be accessed inside the same class. Public can be accessed anywhere.
4. A method should:  (**Select all that apply**) <br/>
(A) Make changes to an object  <<<<<<<<<<<
(B) Return some information about an object  <<<<<<<<<<
(C) Make changes to an object and return information about the object. <<<<<<<<<<<<< 
(D) None of the Above.  


5. How did you determine what to answer for the question above?
I know that methods are meant to make changes to your code and your object. And also some Methods return information about a object. Or in other words Commands and Querys.
## Exercise (10 Points Possible)

Clone your forked copy of this repository into Visual Studio.  

In this solution, there is a User project with a single User class.  The class works, but it needs some additional effort to be great! One thing that is missing is tests; your job is to write the tests that will confirm the functionality of the class. Write one test for the constructor, and at least one test for each of the other 4 methods. As you write the tests, you might find some refactoring opportunities; update the user class with any refactors you deem necessary and add a comment describing why you made that refactor.  The only rule is that all the existing methods must still exist when you are finished!


## Submission

When finished:
* Commit your changes in Visual Studio
* Push up to GitHub
* DM a link to your forked repository to your instructors
